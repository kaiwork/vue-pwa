# vue-pwa

A Personal portfolio build with buefy [https://buefy.org/] . Incorporating pwa and power of CDNs. It just works ! 

The website is hosted at https://kaiwork.github.io/vue-pwa/
using Github Pages.

## Notes
1. This application does not use any bundler. It is meant for a simple technology stack. 
2. There is no CI/CD for this application. 
3. I used buefy is because it has CDN and i don't need to merge various libraries together.
